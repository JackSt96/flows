## Components

We are starting with a pretty standard file organization structure for redux (rails-style).  This components folders will contain components similar to vanilla react. **Notably, in redux, components make no reference to state.  That is handled by containers.**


More detailed exaplanation [here](https://medium.com/@holtkam2/react-redux-understanding-components-containers-actions-and-reducers-a2f9287bfb92).


For future reference, we'll likely want a different structure as our codebase grows.  One example [here](https://engineering.opsgenie.com/how-to-organize-react-files-before-its-messed-up-c85387f691be).
